**Ideas**

**ENHKX Med+) ) ) Drone**




The beginnings of my idea for this project stem from the collection of the multifaceted
academic experiences from my entire lifetime and every chance that I have ever been given
to meet the people who inspired, educated and made me grow as well as various scientific
approaches, methods and techniques that made me curious and determined to find the courage
to attempt to bring my own technological solutions to this world despite bearing in mind
any possible academic and technological obstacles as well as limitations when presented with
some of the most inexplicable problems and the urgent need for how to address them.

Therefore, while experimenting with various combinations of my background knowledge in
academic research and technology, I have finally managed to narrow the areas of interest
that would be fundamentally beneficial for me to further gradually specify the final details
of my idea for a potential technological solution:

1. The impact of the graphic layout on the presentations of materials in coursebooks.
2. This research was a groundbreaking moment in my life. Everything that had led to
   it and everything that has happened ever since that moment is going to reach far
   beyond the scope of this readme file and has its impact till the end of my life.
3. The creation of new means of expression that could be present in the researched
   online media.
4. The analyses of Multimodal Materials in medicine, e.g. clinical trial reports, clinical
   trial designs reports, medical examinations’ descriptions, technical descriptions
   of medicines, medical presentations, medical brochures and medical leaflets.
5. At this stage, being focused on the “mobile first” approach and aware of the gradually
   expanding amounts of data and how to access them easily, the idea which inspired me
   resulted in the SARDatabase project that was focused on the modern mobile devices allowing
   for the internet access and having the mobile network capabilities.

**3.** The creation of new means of expression that could be present in the researched online media.
The study indicates that txting is an efficient transmitter of information in that
it encodes much more information than it itself needs so as to function properly. As a result,
txting might become an efficient transmitter of information, for example, in mobile networks,
which would require the relatively new kind of software that could be able to cooperate with
the already available hardware. The question which emerges at that point is connected with the
development of the communication channels because there is already available technology that
allows for the transmission of huge amounts of data which need to be processed, but the
question remains why it would not be worth decreasing this pressure by optimising the medium,
i.e. the language.

   **This research provided me with an inspiration for the User  Software Maximally Meaning Rich
   and Cost-effective Data Transmission.**

**4.** The analyses of Multimodal Materials in medicine, e.g. clinical trial reports, clinical trial
   designs reports, medical examinations’ descriptions, technical descriptions of medicines,
   medical presentations, medical brochures and medical leaflets.
   Taking into consideration the amounts of such materials created each day, it indicates how
   much time is required to design and produce them. Moreover, it is obligatory that the formats
   and carriers are defined beforehand, so as to guarantee that the formats in which they are
   prepared and delivered to the patients/ customers satisfy the strictest criteria.
   The complexity of the whole process uncovers potential problems. Therefore, there are certain
   questions that one might ask:
1. Is there any possibility to modify the process of the creation of such multimodal
materials, so that scientists would be able to use this time for their research rather
than the materials connected with their research?
2. Is it possible to make the search for unclear medical notions more researcher friendly?
3. Is there any potential solution that allows for the automatic creation of such materials?

   
**This research provided me with an inspiration for the blueprint of the MedPick+ project, consequently,
leading to the evolution stages of the Ideas project i.e.
MedPick+ project  ENHKX Med+) ) ) Drone project ideas project.**

   amounts of data and how to access them easily, the idea which inspired me resulted in the SARDatabase
   project that was focused on the modern mobile devices allowing for the internet access and having
   the mobile network capabilities.

   **Nevertheless, the spectrum of the available tools and solutions appeared to be constantly expanding.
   Therefore, the ideas that this project convenes have been incorporated and serve as the building block
   for the ENHKX Med+) ) ) Drone  ENHKX_Lifeline_Drone_App projects rather than as a separate project.**


   **This project provided me with an inspiration for a reasonable reuse of the already available resources

They enabled me to gradually translate my previous conclusions from the academic research into the real world
solutions where Java has become the technology of choice and the tool used in order to materialise my dreams
about the functional application that would encompass all these previous experiences into a functional
technological solution.

The Ideas application implements the use of the Data Access Object (DAO), i.e. the structural pattern, which in
this case facilitates the functionality of the application by the provision of the clear separation of the data
resource’s client interface from the data access mechanisms.
The current design and organisation of the packages, classes and interfaces are as follows:

1.pl.stormit.ideas

1.1.dao

1.1.1.CategoryDao

1.1.2.QuestionDao

2.handlers

2.1.AnswerCommandHandler

2.2.BaseCommandHandler

2.3.CategoryCommandHandler

2.4.CommandHandler

2.5.HelpCommandHandler

2.6.QuestionCommandHandler

2.7.QuitCommandHandle

3.input

3.1.UserInputCommand

3.2.UserInputManager

4.model

4.1.Answer

4.2.Category

4.3.Question

5.Action

6.Ideas Application

7.QuitIdeasApplicationException


At this stage of the development, it is possible to interact with the application, which is capable of responding
to the user’s input.
